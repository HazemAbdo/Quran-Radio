Listen 24/7 music designed for coding, in your favorite editor: vscode.

## Why

I love this https://quranradio.freecodecamp.org, but i want to listen it 
directly in vscode, so i created this.

## Requirements

You need to have `vlc` installed in order to play the stream.

Also don't forget to check `vlc_path` setting and suits your need.
